# üß† SimSiam: Reproduction and Extension on CIFAR-10

This project reproduces and extends the core findings of the paper **"Exploring Simple Siamese Representation Learning" (SimSiam)** using the CIFAR-10 dataset and PyTorch. The aim is to verify that meaningful representations can be learned without negative samples, large batches, or momentum encoders ‚Äî and to go further with modern enhancements.

## üìå Project Objectives

- ‚úÖ Reproduce SimSiam from scratch in PyTorch
- ‚úÖ Verify performance using **linear probing** and **k-NN evaluation**
- ‚úÖ Perform **ablation studies** on:
  - Removing stop-gradient
  - Removing prediction head
- ‚úÖ Compare SimSiam with:
  - BYOL
  - SwAV
  - SimCLR
- ‚úÖ Test performance with **advanced augmentations**:
  - Mixup
  - CutMix
  - RandAugment

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Note on DINO

DINO was part of the original proposal. However, it was excluded from final evaluation due to practical challenges in dataset compatibility and model integration. Other comparisons (BYOL, SwAV, SimCLR) were completed as planned.
